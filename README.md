## Frontend Development

To change any frontend aspects consider the following hints.

- Do not modify css files. Modify less-files instead and compile them.
- Store images in img-source and use grunt to create different resolutions and minimized versions.
- In order to create minified css and optimized responsive images run from root:
´´´
grunt
´´´
- consider using lazyload for responsive images
